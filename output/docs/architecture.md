# System Architecture

## Architecture Overview

## High-Level Overview

The system architecture is designed using a feature-based organization approach, with a focus on low coupling and high cohesion. The architectural style is currently unknown, but the design patterns used include the Service Layer Pattern. The system is divided into four main layers: Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer, and Infrastructure Layer.

Key design principles include:

* Separation of Concerns (SoC): Each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the system, ensuring that changes to one layer do not affect others.
* Loose Coupling: Components are designed to be independent, reducing the impact of changes to one component on others.
* High Cohesion: Components are designed to be self-contained, with related functionality grouped together.

The overall system approach is to provide a scalable, maintainable, and secure architecture that supports the requirements of the application.

```

This diagram shows the high-level architecture of the system, including the relationships between the different layers and components.

## Core Components

### 1. Presentation Layer

* Frontend technologies and frameworks: The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a framework such as React or Angular.
* UI component structure: The UI is composed of reusable components, each with its own set of responsibilities.
* Client-side state management: The frontend uses a state management library such as Redux or MobX to manage application state.
* User interaction patterns: The frontend handles user interactions, such as clicks and form submissions, and sends requests to the API Gateway.

### 2. Business Logic Layer

* Application logic organization: The application logic is organized into a service layer, which provides a interface for the presentation layer to interact with the business logic.
* Service layer architecture: The service layer is designed using the Service Layer Pattern, which provides a clear separation of concerns between the presentation layer and the business logic.
* Business rules implementation: The business rules are implemented in the application logic, using a rules engine or a custom implementation.
* Processing workflows: The application logic handles processing workflows, such as data validation and processing.

### 3. Data Access Layer

* Database integration patterns: The data access layer uses a database integration pattern, such as the Repository Pattern, to interact with the database.
* Data persistence strategies: The data access layer uses a data persistence strategy, such as caching or lazy loading, to improve performance.
* API design and implementation: The API is designed using a RESTful architecture, with clear and concise endpoints.
* Caching mechanisms: The data access layer uses caching mechanisms, such as Redis or Memcached, to improve performance.

### 4. Infrastructure Layer

* Configuration management: The infrastructure layer uses a configuration management tool, such as Ansible or Puppet, to manage configuration.
* Environment handling: The infrastructure layer uses an environment handling tool, such as Docker or Kubernetes, to manage environments.
* Build and deployment: The infrastructure layer uses a build and deployment tool, such as Jenkins or Travis CI, to manage builds and deployments.
* External integrations: The infrastructure layer handles external integrations, such as API calls to external services.

This sequence diagram shows the data flow architecture of the system, including the interactions between the different components and layers.

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Frontend

* Purpose and responsibility: The frontend is responsible for handling user interactions and rendering the UI.
* Key files and directories: The frontend code is located in the `frontend` directory, with key files including `index.html`, `app.js`, and `components`.
* Dependencies and relationships: The frontend depends on the API Gateway and the External API.
* Performance considerations: The frontend should be optimized for performance, with techniques such as caching, minification, and compression.

### 2. API Gateway

* Purpose and responsibility: The API Gateway is responsible for handling API requests and routing them to the correct service.
* Key files and directories: The API Gateway code is located in the `api-gateway` directory, with key files including `app.js` and `routes`.
