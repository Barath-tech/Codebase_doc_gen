## Technology Stack Summary

- **Server-Side Rendering**: 0 JSP pages
- **Static Content**: 1 HTML pages
- **Styling**: 1 CSS files
- **Client-Side Logic**: 103 JavaScript files

## Web Application Response Patterns

### Client-Side Response Pattern (JavaScript)
```
User Action → JavaScript Handler → DOM Manipulation → Visual Update
     ↑              │                                     │
     │              └── AJAX Request → Server → JSON ──┘
     └────────────────── Interactive Response ──────────────
```

**Characteristics:**
- Immediate user feedback
- Asynchronous server communication
- Dynamic content updates
- Enhanced user experience

## User Experience Flow

### Typical User Journey

```
1. User accesses web application
2. Server processes request
3. Dynamic content generated
4. Response sent to browser
5. Client-side enhancements applied
```


    ## API Endpoints and Web Services

    *REST API endpoints and web service interfaces are documented based on the backend implementation analysis. Refer to the Architecture section for service layer details.*

    ## Security Considerations

    - **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
    - **Session Management**: Secure session handling and timeout policies  
    - **XSS Prevention**: Output encoding and CSP headers
    - **CSRF Protection**: Token-based request validation
