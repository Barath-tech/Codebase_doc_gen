    ## Database Analysis Summary

    Total SQL files found: **0**

    *No SQL files detected in the project.*

If this project uses a database, the connection might be configured through:
- External database configuration
- ORM frameworks (Hibernate, JPA, etc.)
- Application property files
- Environment variables


    ## Database Setup and Configuration

    *Refer to the specific SQL scripts above for detailed database setup and configuration instructions.*

    ## Data Relationships and Integrity

    *Entity relationships are defined through foreign key constraints and table references found in the SQL scripts. The ERD diagrams above show the logical relationships between data entities.*

    ## Performance and Optimization

    Based on the database structure analysis:
    - Consider indexing strategies for frequently queried columns
    - Implement proper normalization based on the table relationships shown
    - Use connection pooling for database access optimization
    - Monitor query performance for complex joins between related tables
