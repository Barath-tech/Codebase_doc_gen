<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
<h1>System Architecture Documentation</h1>
<h2>High-Level Overview</h2>
<p>The system architecture is designed using a feature-based organization approach, with a focus on low coupling and high cohesion. The architectural style is currently unknown, but the design patterns used include the Service Layer Pattern. The system is divided into four main layers: Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer, and Infrastructure Layer.</p>
<p>Key design principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separation of Concerns (SoC): Each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the system, ensuring that changes to one layer do not affect others.</li>
<li>Loose Coupling: Components are designed to be independent, reducing the impact of changes to one component on others.</li>
<li>High Cohesion: Components are designed to be self-contained, with related functionality grouped together.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall system approach is to provide a scalable, maintainable, and secure architecture that supports the requirements of the application.</p>

<h2>Database Relations</h2>
<h3>One-to-Many Relations</h3>
<p>The <code>users</code> table has a one-to-many relationship with the <code>orders</code> table, as each user can place multiple orders. The <code>orders</code> table has a one-to-many relationship with the <code>order_items</code> table, as each order can contain multiple items.</p>
<p>The business logic behind these relationships is that a user can place multiple orders, and each order can contain multiple items. The data integrity consideration is that each order must be associated with a valid user, and each order item must be associated with a valid order and product.</p>
<h3>Many-to-Many Relations</h3>
<p>The <code>orders</code> table has a many-to-many relationship with the <code>products</code> table, as each order can contain multiple products, and each product can be part of multiple orders. This relationship is implemented through the <code>order_items</code> table, which acts as a junction table.</p>
<p>The junction table analysis shows that each order item is associated with one order and one product, and each order and product can have multiple order items. The complex relationship handling is done through the use of foreign keys and the junction table.</p>
<p>The performance implication of this relationship is that queries involving the <code>orders</code> and <code>products</code> tables may be slower due to the need to join the tables through the <code>order_items</code> table.</p>
<h2>Data Access Patterns</h2>
<p>The application interacts with the data through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The query patterns used are primarily SELECT statements with JOINs and subqueries to retrieve data from multiple tables.</p>
<p>The optimization strategy used is to minimize the number of queries and use indexing to improve query performance. The connection management is done through the use of a connection pool, which improves performance by reusing existing connections.</p>
<p>The transaction handling is done through the use of atomic transactions, which ensure that either all or none of the operations within a transaction are committed to the database.</p>
<h2>Database Migrations</h2>
<p>The schema evolution strategy used is to create a new migration script for each change to the database schema. The migration management is done through the use of a migration tool, which applies the migration scripts to the database in the correct order.</p>
<p>The version control integration is done through the use of Git, which tracks changes to the migration scripts and the database schema. The rollback procedures are in place to revert the database to a previous version in case of errors or issues.</p>
<h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
<p>The indexing strategy used is to create indexes on columns used in WHERE and JOIN clauses. The query optimization is done through the use of EXPLAIN and ANALYZE statements to identify performance bottlenecks.</p>
<p>The connection pooling is used to improve performance by reusing existing connections. The caching approaches used are query caching and result caching, which store frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the number of database queries.</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>The access control mechanisms used are role-based access control and row-level security, which restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles and permissions.</p>
<p>The data encryption used is SSL/TLS encryption, which encrypts data in transit between the application and the database. The audit trails are used to track changes to the database and detect potential security breaches.</p>
<p>The backup and recovery procedures are in place to ensure that data is backed up regularly and can be recovered in case of errors or issues. The backups are stored securely and are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>Protected Routes</h2>
<p>The protected routes are secured using an authentication system, which checks for a valid token in the request header.</p>
<p>Location: <code>path/to/protection</code></p>
<h3>Route Protection Logic</h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const authenticate = (req, res, next) =&gt; {
  const token = req.header('Authorization');
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).send('Access denied. No token provided.');
  }
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secretkey');
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (ex) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid token.');
  }
};
</code></pre>
<h3>Protected Routes Configuration</h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const authenticate = require('./authenticate');

router.get('/api/data', authenticate, (req, res) =&gt; {
  // Return data
});

router.post('/api/data', authenticate, (req, res) =&gt; {
  // Create data
});

router.put('/api/data/:id', authenticate, (req, res) =&gt; {
  // Update data
});

router.delete('/api/data/:id', authenticate, (req, res) =&gt; {
  // Delete data
});
</code></pre>
